## The Project

This project was an accumulation of four weeks of intense training on HTML, CSS, JS, & JQuery. The goal of the project was to build a working trivia game utilizing what was learned.

## The Details

The idea was to create a simple loading page that provided links for three types of trivia questions. These questions would appear via a JS popup. What began as a simple idea became a major labor of love. I decided to utilize Bootstrap to make a more aesthetic and responsive site that would better bring my ideas to fruition.

I ran into enough issues with my JS that I started to feel like I was making less and less progress. However, I learned what doesn't work and how to become better at debugging.

This is a working project. The end goal is to have an event handler tied to the carousel buttons that will open a survey with different difficulty levels based on the button clicked.

More to be added at a future date.
