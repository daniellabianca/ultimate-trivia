# Feedback

Great job on finishing this project strong! I know it was a struggle at times, but overall you built a really beautiful game. The interface is very creative and visually pleasing - you absolutely rocked the design! Make sure when writing your readme files that you're using markdown syntax. Here is a little [cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) you can take a look at for next time. Your code is organized very well, however, it seems like there was a lot of copying/pasting from resources online. I'd make sure you're first using the CDN to each library and then only adding necessary code into your custom css and js files to edit what's being rendered originally. In the future I'd make sure to hit your MVP before building out other functionality (i.e. getting "easy" to work flawlessly before adding in "tough" and "impossible" levels).
